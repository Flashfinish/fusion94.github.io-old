<h2>BustinOut</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>BustinOut is is a clone of the game Breakout which is an arcade game developed by Atari, Inc and introduced on May 13, 
1976. It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, and influenced by the 1972 arcade game Pong, also by 
Atari. The game was ported to video game consoles and upgraded to video games such as Super Breakout. In addition, 
Breakout was the basis and inspiration for books, video games, film, and the Apple II personal computer.

<p>In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the 
top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player 
loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable 
paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.

<p>This is a mobile game written for a variety of different devices using a variety of different frameworks.
