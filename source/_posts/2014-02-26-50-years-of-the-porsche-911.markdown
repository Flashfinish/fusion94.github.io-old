The Porsche 911, among the most acclaimed sports car of all time (and one I consider probably the most iconic and quintessential) is officially 50 years old this year. 

Originally introduced in 1963, its original silhouette remains recognizable after more than five decades of modifications, and it continues to be the best-selling Porsche model by far.

It originally debuted as the Type 901 at the IAA International Automotive Show in September of 1963. Production of the new Porsche began in September 1964. Of the first 232 cars built in 1964, the first 82 received the 901 designation. The other 150 were labeled as 911s, though the 901 nomenclature continued to be used for internal parts designation for years thereafter.

232 911s were built in 1964, of which only 45 are known to exist today and fetch a pretty premium.

Since it was announced in 1963, and first sold in 1964, more than 820,000 Porsche 911's have been built and sold.

My 911 is a 1999 Type-996 Carrera Cabriolet with the following base stats:

* **Engine:** 3.4 Liter Flat 6-cylinder
* **Drivetrain:** Rear wheel drive
* **Transmission:** 6-speed manual
* **Horse Power:** 296 @ 6800 rpm
* **Torque:** 258 @ 4600 rpm
* **Weight:** 2,910 pounds

I've also added the Fister Stage II Exhaust system which consists of adding an external partial bypass pipe as well as internal alterations. This lightens the muffler by a couple of pounds and gives it itâ€™s unique tone. It's also added about 30 hp bumping me to about 326hp @ 6800rpm.
