Quite often you'll find a company that makes an announcement similar to this:

>Today, we are excited to launch the public beta of **FOO**, a new **WIDGET** that's deeply programmable but also easy to use.

This is generally pretty awesome if you have interest in this particular type of **WIDGET** until they ask you to _"Request a beta invite"_ using your email address.

<!-- more -->

To increase your chances of getting into the aforementioned beta all you need is a gmail account.

As you know, you can append most anything to your gmail address using the `+` sign. So for example, you could register 10 or more times using an email address such as:

`gmailemail+beta1@gmail.com`

`gmailemail+beta2@gmail.com`

`gmailemail+beta3@gmail.com`

`gmailemail+beta4@gmail.com`

`gmailemail+beta5@gmail.com`

and so on and so on. 

If the company in question is using a lottery system to pull beta invitations out of the database based on email addresses you have now increased your odds of winning. **DUH**
