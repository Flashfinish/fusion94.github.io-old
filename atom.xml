<p>After using it full time for the better part of this time I can say that I believe that this will become my full time editor of choice completely replacing Sublime Text 3.</p>

<p>As such I&rsquo;ve started to port over a couple of themes that I used in both Textmate and Sublime Text.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will be a little different than most of my posts. I&rsquo;d like to talk a bit about my son (Patrick, named after my mother, Patricia, who died of cancer in 2003) and a Legacy<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>[1]</a></sup> that my son will hear about but hopefully will not abide<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>[2]</a></sup> by.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My son turned 14 months old today. I was 43 years old when he was born. It was absolutely the best moment of my life. Nothing can ever compare to seeing him for the first time or holding him just moments after he left the womb. It left me awestruck and amazed.</p>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/blog/legacy/pg1.jpg"></p>

<p>I will do anything to protect him. If anyone tried to harm him I would absolutely destroy them and their existence from this planet. No question. I would willingly give up my life for his in an instant.</p>

<h3>The Legacy</h3>

<p>Now many of you will now be asking <em>&ldquo;What is this legacy?&rdquo;</em> Well it&rsquo;s the legacy of the Combat Infantryman&rsquo;s Badge (hereafter referred to as the CIB). Yes I have one, as does Patrick&rsquo;s Grandfather and his Great-Grandfather.</p>

<p>Now you may be asking yourself: <em>&ldquo;What is the CIB?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/blog/legacy/cib.gif"></p>

<blockquote><p>The <strong>Combat Infantryman Badge (CIB)</strong> is a United States Army military award. The badge is awarded to infantrymen and Special Forces Soldiers in the rank of Colonel and below, who personally fought in active ground combat while assigned as members of either an infantry, Ranger or Special Forces unit, of brigade size or smaller, any time after 6 December 1941.</p>

<p>The CIB and its non-combat contemporary, the Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB) were simultaneously created during World War II to enhance the morale and prestige of service in the infantry. Specifically, it recognizes the <strong>inherent sacrifices of all infantrymen</strong>, and that, in comparison to all other military occupational specialties, infantrymen face the greatest risk of being <strong>wounded or killed in action</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Patrick&rsquo;s Great-Grandfather earned his CIB during World War II fighting with the 69th Infantry Division comprising of (3) Infantry regiments of 3,254 men that fought in places such as the Battle of the Bulge (26-Dec-1944), Attacking the Siegfried Line (27-Feb-1945), Battle for Kassel (05-Apr-1945), Battle for Leipzig (18-Apr-1945), and the Linkup with the Soviet 58th Guards in Berlin (25-Apr-1945).</p>

<p>Patrick&rsquo;s Grandfather earned his CIB while on the Korean DMZ from 1969-1970 with the 2nd Infantry Division.</p>

<p>Patrick&rsquo;s Father earned his CIB while attached to 18th Airborne Corps during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm.</p>

<p>My Grandfather (Patrick&rsquo;s Great-Grandfather) pinned on me the <strong>CIB</strong> that he earned during WWII. Not a replica, the actual <strong>CIB</strong> that was awarded to him in 1945. It was absolutely one of the finest moments of my life.</p>

<p>It is an honor that&rsquo;s difficult to describe. I have never been as proud as I was that day. At that moment I became part of a brotherhood that was far bigger than myself. A brotherhood that was a legacy and a huge cross to bear.</p>

<p>Up until that point, my grandfather hadn&rsquo;t really spoken of his time in service. After that day he opened up to me in ways that I never knew existed. We spoke at length in regards to what we had experienced and found common ground. While serving almost 50 years apart we shared the same experiences and both suffered from what now is referred to as PTSD (Shell Shock in his day).</p>

<p>It was difficult for my Grandfather to open up, less difficult to open up to me as we had both faced the elephant in the room for better or for worse.</p>

<h3>A New Beginning</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not planning on telling Patrick about the <strong>CIB</strong>, having said that neither will I lie about it.</p>

<p>I hope to God that in the future he will never have the opportunity to
experience his family&rsquo;s legacy. I desperately hope that my son never has to go to war or see combat in any way, shape, form or fashion.</p>

<p><strong>This will be my legacy to him.</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quite often you&rsquo;ll find a company that makes an announcement similar to this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Today, we are excited to launch the public beta of <strong>FOO</strong>, a new <strong>WIDGET</strong> that&rsquo;s deeply programmable but also easy to use.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is generally pretty awesome if you have interest in this particular type of <strong>WIDGET</strong> until they ask you to <em>&ldquo;Request a beta invite&rdquo;</em> using your email address.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>To increase your chances of getting into the aforementioned beta all you need is a gmail account.</p>

<p>As you know, you can append most anything to your gmail address using the <code>+</code> sign. So for example, you could register 10 or more times using an email address such as:</p>

<p><code>gmailemail+beta1@gmail.com</code></p>

<p><code>gmailemail+beta2@gmail.com</code></p>

<p><code>gmailemail+beta3@gmail.com</code></p>

<p><code>gmailemail+beta4@gmail.com</code></p>

<p><code>gmailemail+beta5@gmail.com</code></p>

<p>and so on and so on.</p>

<p>If the company in question is using a lottery system to pull beta invitations out of the database based on email addresses you have now increased your odds of winning. <strong>DUH</strong></p>

    <link href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2014/02/25/using-octpress-from-two-computers/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-25T06:12:33-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2014/02/25/using-octpress-from-two-computers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog post covers how recreate a local repository of your <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> blog. I needed to figure out how to do this so that I could update my blog from both my personal desktop and my laptop.</p>

<div class="info">Note: This solution will only work with the <b>2.x</b> version of Octopress. For the 3.x version there&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/octopress/deploy">Octopress Deploy</a></div>




<!-- more -->


<h3>How Octopress Works</h3>

<p>Octopress repositories have two branches, <code>source</code> and <code>master</code>. The source branch contains the files that are used to generate the blog and the <code>master</code> contains the blog itself.</p>

<p>When the local folders are initially configured according to the Octopress Setup Guide, the <code>master</code> branch is stored in a subfolder named <code>_deploy</code>. Since the folder name begins with an underscore, it is ignored when you <code>git push origin source</code>. Instead, the <code>master</code> branch (which contains your blog posts) gets updated when you <code>rake deploy</code>.</p>

<div class="hr"></div>


<h3>Recreating an Octopress repository</h3>

<p>To recreate the local directory structure of an existing Octopress blog, follow these instructions.</p>

<p>First you will need to clone the <code>source</code> branch to a local octopress folder.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone -b <span class="nb">source </span>git@github.com:username/username.github.com.git octopress
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then clone the <code>master</code> branch to the <code>_deploy</code> subfolder.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>octopress
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone git@github.com:username/username.github.com.git _deploy
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then run the rake installation to configure everything</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>gem install bundler
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rbenv rehash    <span class="c"># If you use rbenv, rehash to be able to run the bundle command</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>bundle install
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rake setup_github_pages
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It will prompt you for your repository URL.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Enter the <span class="nb">read</span>/write url <span class="k">for </span>your repository
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">(</span>For example, <span class="err">&#39;</span>git@github.com:your_username/your_username.github.com<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You are now setup with a new local copy of your existing Octopress blog.</p>

<div class="hr"></div>


<h3>Pushing changes from two different machines</h3>

<p>If you want to blog from more than one computer, you need to make sure that you push everything before switching computers. From the first machine do the following whenever you’ve made changes:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rake generate
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git add .
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -am <span class="s2">&quot;Some comment here.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git push origin <span class="nb">source</span>  <span class="c"># update the remote source branch </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rake deploy             <span class="c"># update the remote master branch</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then on the second machine, you will need to pull down those changes.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>octopress
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git pull origin <span class="nb">source</span>  <span class="c"># update the local source branch</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ./_deploy
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git pull origin master  <span class="c"># update the local master branch</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <link href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2014/02/15/hearthstone-beta/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-15T07:36:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2014/02/15/hearthstone-beta</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blizzard&rsquo;s latest game, <a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/">Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</a> entered open beta on January 21st, 2014, opening it all for all Mac and PC users in North America. Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft is currently a free-to-play collectible card game that revolves around turn-based online 1v1 matches between two opponents.</p>

<p>Hearthstone is set within the Warcraft universe, with the majority of its characters and cards drawing from existing lore.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/blog/hearthstone/screenshot1.png"></p>

<h3>Matches</h3>

<p>Each Hearthstone battle is a 1vs1 match between two opponents. Gameplay in Hearthstone is turn-based, with players taking turns to play cards from their hand, casting spells, equipping weapons, or summoning &lsquo;minions&rsquo; to do battle on their behalf. Play may be between two human players, or one player and a computer-controlled opponent.</p>

<br>


<p>Each player is represented by their chosen &lsquo;hero&rsquo;, an important character from Warcraft lore. Each hero represents a particular class, determining the special cards and unique hero power available to them. Each hero has 30 Health &ndash; if that number is reduced to zero, the hero is destroyed, and the controlling player has lost the game. The available heroes and classes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mage (Jaina Proudmoore)</li>
<li>Priest (Anduin Wrynn)</li>
<li>Warlock (Gul&#8217;dan)</li>
<li>Paladin (Uther the Lightbringer)</li>
<li>Warrior (Garrosh Hellscream)</li>
<li>Druid (Malfurion Stormrage)</li>
<li>Hunter (Rexxar)</li>
<li>Rogue (Valeera Sanguinar)</li>
<li>Shaman (Thrall)</li>
</ul>


<br>


<p>At the start of each turn, the player draws a new card from their deck &ndash; a collection of 30 cards selected before battle. Players can choose to play using one of several pre-assembled &lsquo;basic&rsquo; decks, or one of their own custom-made decks. While most cards are available to heroes of any class, a substantial portion are limited to a specific class, giving each hero their own strengths and unique possibilities.</p>

<br>


<p>During their turn, each player can choose to play any of their cards, use their hero power, command their minions to attack targets, or attack directly using their hero, if they have a weapon equipped. However, which actions the player is able to take is partly determined by their mana. Each player starts the game with 1 mana crystal, and gains one more at the start of each turn, until the maximum of 10 is reached. Each card and hero power requires the player to expend a specific amount of mana in order to play it, strategically limiting each player&rsquo;s actions. In addition, the larger mana pools in later rounds allow players to play increasingly expensive cards, opening the game up to ever more impressive moves and powerful abilities.</p>

<br>


<p>A match is concluded when one or both players has reached zero health, or chooses to concede. Completing a battle will grant each player hero experience (winning earns additional experience) and granting them access to additional cards up to level 10 or golden versions of basic cards past level 10.</p>

<br>


<p>Each match takes place on a randomly selected battlefield, representing the board on which the game is played. There are currently four possible battlefields: Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Pandaria and Stranglethorn. Each battlefield features its own design and numerous interactive elements, but gameplay is in no way affected or determined by battlefield selection.</p>

<h3>Cards</h3>

<p>Cards are the main substance of Hearthstone, representing the abilities, characters and effects which each player is able to make use of during the match. There are currently 382 cards in the game, with more planned to be added to the game later through the introduction of expansion packs and &lsquo;adventures&rsquo;.</p>

<br>


<p>In all game modes except Arena, the player does battle using a deck of 30 cards, constructed from cards in the player&rsquo;s collection. Each deck can only feature two of each card, and only one of each legendary card. Arena play features no such limitations, but requires players to play using a new deck chosen from a series of randomly provided selections. For either type of deck, the construction of a player&rsquo;s deck is a key strategic element in the game, determining which cards are available to them during the course of a match.</p>

<br>


<p>Each player starts the game with a wide selection of basic cards. Cards of higher rarity can be obtained by purchasing card packs, or as rewards from Arena mode. Card packs and entry to the Arena can be purchased using real money, or gold, an in-game currency earned through completing special &lsquo;quests&rsquo;, such as winning a certain number of matches, or dealing a certain amount of damage. Each card pack consists of five random cards, including at least one rare card. Obtaining new cards allows the player to add them to their decks, opening up new possibilities for play and strategy.</p>

<br>


<p>Players can also use the crafting system to create new cards. The system uses arcane dust to craft specific cards. Arcane dust can be obtained as an Arena reward, or by destroying existing cards, allowing players to convert unwanted cards into more desirable options. The crafting system was created as an alternative to the player card trading prevalent in trading card games such as Magic: The Gathering, with no plans for cards to be traded between players.</p>

<br>


<p>Similar to the foils found in physical collectible card games, Hearthstone features golden cards, special versions of regular cards featuring a golden border and unique animations. These cards are far harder to obtain than their regular versions, and cost more arcane dust to craft. Golden cards differ from their regular counterparts purely cosmetically, and are designed to allow players to show off their accomplishments.</p>

<h3>Game Modes</h3>

<p>Four main game modes are available to play in Hearthstone.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Practice mode, players can play against a selection of computer opponents. Players can learn the basics of the game battling against &lsquo;basic&rsquo; opponents, or can put their skills to the test against improved &lsquo;expert&rsquo; opponents.</li>
<li>Play mode matches players against other human players of similar skill, in random matches. Players can choose to play Casual &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; games, or take part in Ranked play, earning special medals to reflect their skill and standing within the community. Ranked play features a 26-tier rank system, with wins allowing the player to progress to higher ranks, and losses causing them to descend in rank. The highest rank is called Legend. This rank cannot be lost until the season ends and the rank features the exact ranking in your region. All ranks are reset at the end of each season, with each season lasting for about one month. Ranked play is also planned to provide special cosmetic rewards for participation, such as golden heroes and alternative card backs.</li>
<li>Arena mode, which costs in-game gold or real money to play, has the player drafting a deck by choosing between 3 cards until they have picked 30. Players then use their drafted deck to do battle in a series of games against other Arena players. Each Arena run lasts until the player has reached three losses or twelve wins, or chooses to retire their deck, at which point they are granted a number of rewards determined by the total number of games won. While constructed decks have card restrictions, Arena decks have no such card limits.</li>
<li>Duels allow players to challenge players on their friends list to unranked matches. Duels offer no rewards, but allow players to play games outside of the other game modes.</li>
</ul>


<p>The game also features a Tutorial, a limited and non-repeatable starting experience designed to introduce players to Hearthstone, in which the player is pitched against a series of special opponents, with substantial dialogue elements.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Overall I think Hearthstone has been done really well and I&rsquo;m enjoying my time there. My understanding is that the game will always be free to play but that Blizzard will charge for card packs. I also know that they are planning to release game clients for Hearthstone for iPhone, iPad and Android sometime after the official launch.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re so inclined feel free to download the game and friend me using my gamertag of <strong>fusion94#1276</strong></p>

    <link href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2014/02/12/managerial-mistakes/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-12T09:30:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2014/02/12/managerial-mistakes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest here. We&rsquo;ve all suffered at some point in our careers from bad managers and/or ineffective leadership. Why is this the case?</p>

<p>Many (if not most) bad managers lack basic training in managing people. But, even more importantly, these same managers generally lack the core values, professionalism, initiative, sensitivity, character, and situational awareness needed to interact effectively all day long with people.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>tl:dr</h3>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>Please refer to <strong>Wheaton’s Law</strong> which is an internet axiom which states <strong><em>“Don’t be a dick.”</em></strong> It was originally used in the context of sportsmanship in online gaming but its scope was eventually expanded to apply to life in general.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Skills and techniques are relatively easy to teach, but <strong>values</strong>, <strong>beliefs</strong>, <strong>attitude</strong>, and <strong>character</strong> are much harder to teach and are <strong>much</strong> harder for managers to learn. Yet, these are the underlying soft skills that will most make managers a success or a failure.</p>

<p>These basic traits (<strong>values</strong>, <strong>beliefs</strong>, and <strong>attitude</strong>) fall under the very character of the manager. The consequence of not training character is not limited to diminished judgment  and adaptive ability; it also impacts the manager himself. When a manager intentionally violates a code or institutional ethos while in the context of doing their job , then they are destroying the very bedrock of their self-respect and leadership skills.</p>

<p>In a modern organization that <strong><em>values it&rsquo;s employees</em></strong>, you&rsquo;ll want to hire and/or select managers who exhibit many (if not all) of the characteristics listed below. <strong><em>If you don&rsquo;t then you&rsquo;re only contributing to the problem.</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Able</strong> to hold people accountable and responsible without taking punitive actions</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate</strong> leadership and clear direction</li>
<li><strong>Believe</strong> in teamwork</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong> people</li>
<li><strong>Believe</strong> in frequent effective communication and listening</li>
<li><strong>Want</strong> to create an environment where employees are empowered</li>
</ul>


<h3>There are fundamentally 6 mistakes that bad managers make:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Failing to provide clear direction to your employees:</strong><br>
Managers quite often fail to create proper standards and provide empoyees with clear expectations so they know what they are supposed to do. That same manager will then wonder why those employees fail. If you make <strong>every</strong> task a priority, people will soon believe that there are <strong>no priorities</strong>.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failing to trust your employees:</strong><br>
When managers <strong>fail</strong> to trust their employees to do their jobs, their lack of trust plays out in a number of detrimental ways. Micromanaging comes to mind immediately. For example this manager will generally:</p>

<ul>
<li>resist delegating</li>
<li>take back delegated work before it is finished if they find a mistake in it</li>
<li>immerse themselves in overseeing the projects of others<br><br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Failing to react to problems and issues:</strong><br>
Bad managers often think that an issue, whether it be a conflict or disagreement will just go away on its own if they ignore it. I hate to break it to you. <strong>It won&rsquo;t</strong>. Issues will just get worse unless something changes or the issue is properly addressed.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failing to get to know your employees:</strong><br>
Developing a relationship with employees is a major key in managing those employees. While you don&rsquo;t want or need to be their counselor you <strong>do</strong> want/need to know what&rsquo;s going on in their lives. Knowing that the family dog died, expressing sympathy, or that his/her daughter graduated high school make you an interested, involved boss.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Making decisions and then asking people for their input:</strong><br>
You cannot make a decision and then ask people for their feedback while ignoring said feedback. This, in reality, is an <strong>edict</strong>.  You also should not create hierarchical steps and other roadblocks that teach employees that their ideas are subject to veto and then wonder why no one has any suggestions/feedback for improvement.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failing to communicate effectively and withholding important information:</strong><br>
The best form of communications is <strong>transparent</strong> in nature. While some information that you&rsquo;re privy to might be confidential in nature share what you know as soon as allowable. Information <strong>is</strong> criticial for your employees to make good decisions. There&rsquo;s a reason the phrase is: <strong><em>informed decisions</em></strong>.<br></p></li>
</ul>


<h3>7 Successful Management Traits:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Understanding your role:</strong><br>
Management requires the ability to build and/or hire a team that can perform and shine. Don&rsquo;t forget that <strong><em>Your success comes from their success</em></strong>. The manager&rsquo;s role is to <strong>facilitate</strong> what people on the team do well and to <strong>remove</strong> any obstacles blocking the team from performing effectively.<br><br>For example, a financial executive who becomes the chief executive does not abandon his/her original expertise, but he/she does abandon their old role and embraces the role of mentor. If he/she doesn’t, they will smother their own baby. <strong><em>Don&rsquo;t kill the baby</em></strong><br><br>On the other hand, if an executive moves too far in the opposite direction, the result will be just as deadly. The person who clears obstacles for his team and obstinately protects them “no matter what” will lose sight of their shortcomings and lose sight of the mission.<br><br>Mission first and <strong>people always</strong>.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keeping the team unified:</strong><br>
Once you have the team solidified, stay <strong>alert</strong> for any sign of discourse. When you notice it, use the tools you have relied on throughout your career to strengthen interpersonal bonds. If that means creating situations in which your employees rally against you, then do so, but do it in a way that makes the condition temporal.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not fall victim to deference:</strong><br>
Deference is a double-edged sword. If you get <strong>accustomed</strong> to having employees defer to you, you <strong>will</strong> stop growing as a manager. It will destroy, <strong>your credibility</strong>. Sometimes you have to <strong>admit</strong> that you don’t have all the answers. Reliance on other employees is another way to bond your team as you establish yourself as a self-aware leader.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dealing with differences:</strong><br>
Even if you have hired everyone around you and everyone seems to speak the same language, nobody thinks exactly the same way <strong>you</strong> do. You may follow the same process and have the same mental attributes, but you and your employees are different. And some of what they do may seem ridiculous to you.<br><br>To successfullly deal with these differences, you will need to be able to <strong>identify</strong> them. And then, once you have, you have to decide whether each is a source of strength for the organization, or is detrimental to the team.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Mentality:</strong><br>
To successfully lead a team of talented people, you must <strong>focus on serving them</strong>. Your job is to clear obstructions, distractions and excuses. You streamline processes and keep the political nonsense at arms length.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Give personal attention:</strong><br>
To become a great manager, you must make your employees success into your own success. Take the <strong>time</strong> to coach, train, and mentor them. Provide them regular feedback on their performance and their shortcomings knowing that your best employees will crave candidness and honesty. In short, <strong><em>make your employees feel valued</em></strong>.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide experience:</strong><br>
Everyone, generally starts at the bottom of the food chain. Great employees care about where they want to go and will need <strong>your help</strong> to get them there. They know you were once in the same position they are in and want to see how to get to where you are today. So take some <strong>time</strong> to help your people understand the business. <strong>Expose</strong> them to every part of the operation to round off their skills. <strong>Develop</strong> and <strong>groom</strong> them to take over your position.<br></p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Bad Management is about not caring about anything other than yourself. Good Management isn&rsquo;t in fact management at all but rather leadership. If you&rsquo;re a good manager then you&rsquo;re a leader. You can&rsquo;t have one without the other.</p>

    <link href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/12/09/top-10-shell-commands-used/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-09T09:26:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/12/09/top-10-shell-commands-used</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From time to time, I like to analyze which unix or linux shell commands I&rsquo;m using most frequently. To do this, all I need is a little awk, like the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>history | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So what does this do?</p>

<p>Basically, it parses your history looking at the 2nd column, which is the command you typed and increments it each time it is found. Then it displays a sorted report showing the count of the command and the command, like this example on my MacBook Pro:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1353 git
</span><span class='line'>749 cd
</span><span class='line'>391 ssh
</span><span class='line'>379 ls
</span><span class='line'>194 rake
</span><span class='line'>168 vagrant
</span><span class='line'>152 sublime
</span><span class='line'>143 rvm
</span><span class='line'>135 rm
</span><span class='line'>119 bundle</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Based on this output of the top 10 most frequently used shell commands, it shows that I&rsquo;m using git, and ls quite a bit so it would be helpful to create aliases for these commands. Here are a few examples:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>alias g="git"
</span><span class='line'>alias l="ls -al"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now that I know git is one of my most used commands I can parse my history to determine what git command I use most frequently:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>history | awk '{print $2 " " $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | grep "git" | head     </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output of that command provides me with this information:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'> 200 git push
</span><span class='line'> 191 git commit
</span><span class='line'> 172 git status
</span><span class='line'> 105 git branch
</span><span class='line'> 103 git clone
</span><span class='line'>  99 git checkout
</span><span class='line'>  79 git remote
</span><span class='line'>  49 git fetch</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>This now allows me to tailor my aliases for git accordingly.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>alias gp="git push"
</span><span class='line'>alias gc="git commit -m"
</span><span class='line'>alias gs="git status"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By tailoring your aliases appropriately you can speed up your workflow significantly, as well as reduce the wear and tear on your fingers.</p>

    <link href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/04/09/an-inconvenient-truth-about-assault-rifles/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-09T22:16:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/04/09/an-inconvenient-truth-about-assault-rifles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s start by clearing up a few misconceptions about so-called &ldquo;assault rifles&rdquo;.  Technically speaking an assault rifle is a selective fire (selectable among either fully automatic, burst-capable, or, sometimes, semi-automatic modes of operation) rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This means that an assault rifle must contain 3 distinct features:
* Selective fire control between fully automatic, burst-capable, and single shot modes of operation  <strong>AND</strong>
* Use of an intermediate cartridge <strong>AND</strong>
* Use of a detachable magazine</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve established what constitutes an &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo; let&rsquo;s look at each of these items in greater detail.</p>

<h3>Selective Fire</h3>

<blockquote>A selective fire firearm has at least one semi–automatic and one automatic mode, which is activated by means of a selector which varies depending on the weapon&#8217;s design. Some selective fire weapons utilize burst fire mechanisms to limit the maximum number of shots fired automatically in this mode. The most common limits are two or three rounds per trigger pull. Fully automatic fire refers to the ability for a rifle to fire continuously until the magazine is empty. &#8220;Burst-capable&#8221; fire refers to the ability of a rifle to fire a small yet fixed multiple number of rounds with one trigger pull. Semi-automatic refers to the ability to fire one round per trigger pull. The presence of selective fire modes on assault rifles permits more efficient use of rounds to be fired for specific needs, versus having a single mode of operation, such as fully automatic, thereby conserving ammunition while maximizing on-target accuracy and effectiveness.</blockquote>


<h3>Intermediate Cartridge</h3>

<blockquote>An intermediate cartridge is a military assault rifle cartridge that is less powerful than typical full power battle rifle cartridges such as the 7.62x54mm Rimmed, UK .303 or US .30-06 Springfield, but still significantly more powerful than pistol cartridges. As their recoil is significantly reduced compared to high power rifle cartridges, fully automatic rifles firing intermediate cartridges are relatively easy to control. However, even though less powerful than a traditional rifle cartridge, the ballistics are still sufficient for an effective range of 250–500 metres (270–550 yd), which are the maximum typical engagement ranges in combat. This allowed for the development of the assault rifle concept, which is a selective fire weapon that is more compact and lighter than rifles firing full power cartridges. The first intermediate cartridge to see widespread service was the German 7.92x33mm Kurz. Other examples include the Soviet 7.62x39mm used in the AK-47 and AKM series, and the .280 British round developed for the EM-2. The 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge is also an intermediate cartridge.</blockquote>


<h3>Detachable Magazine</h3>

<blockquote>A detachable magazine is a self-contained mechanism capable of being loaded or unloaded while detached from the host firearm. They are attached via a slot in the firearm receiver usually below the action but occasionally to the side (Sten, FG42, Johnson LMG) or on top (Madsen machine gun, Bren gun, FN P90). When the magazine is empty, it can be detached from the firearm and replaced by another full magazine. This significantly speeds the process of reloading, allowing the operator quick access to ammunition. This type of magazine may be straight or curved, the curve being necessary if the rifle uses rimmed ammunition or ammunition with a tapered case.</blockquote>


<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve identified what features are needed to make an &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo; let&rsquo;s do a visual test.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/ar1.jpg"></p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/ar2.jpg"></p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/ar3.jpg"></p>

<p>So which of these 3 examples is an &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo; according to the definition above?  All three of them look very similar. But do they adhere to the definition?</p>

<ul>
<li>Example A while using both an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine does not have a selective fire control.</li>
<li>Example B uses both an intermediate cartridge, a detachable magazine, and is capable of selective fire.</li>
<li>Example C has selective fire control, a detachable magazine but doesn&rsquo;t use an intermediate cartridge. As a matter of record it&rsquo;s not even considered a firearm as it&rsquo;s an Airsoft gun.</li>
</ul>


<p>So Example B is the only one with all 3 features and is the only &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo; of the group. While they all look similar to one another they are not all &ldquo;assault rifles&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s do one more visual test to see if we&rsquo;ve learned anything.</p>

<h4>Example 4</h4>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/ar4.jpg"></p>

<h4>Example 5</h4>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/ar5.jpg"></p>

<h4>Example 6</h4>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/ar6.jpg"></p>

<h4>Example 7</h4>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/ar7.jpg"></p>

<p>So which of these 4 examples is an &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo; according to the definition above?  Sorry it&rsquo;s a trick question. While all 4 have a detachable magazine none of them have selective fire or use an intermediate cartridge. So none of them is an &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo;. As a matter of fact all 4 of them are the same firearm just with different stocks put into place. Some are just a bit more &ldquo;scary&rdquo; looking than the others. The issue is that &ldquo;scary&rdquo; looking doesn&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t define an &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The fact is that what really constitutes an &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo; is actually called &ldquo;Selective Fire Weapons&rdquo;.  Selective fire weapons are regulated in the United States under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Act">National Firearms Act</a> of 1934; their new manufacture for the civilian market was prohibited by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act">Firearm Owners Protection Act</a> of 1986. Those still in circulation often command prices significantly higher than similar models still available to law enforcement and military agencies and are highly regulated by the ATF.</p>

<h1>But for the sake of argument let&rsquo;s now agree that anything that looks like a military style weapon is an &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo;.</h1>

<h3>The Statistics about Assault Rifles</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8">Uniform Crime Reports</a> compiled by the FBI to determine how deadly or how often an &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo; is used in homicides.</p>

<iframe width='675' height='425' frameborder='0' src='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AizXDsCEsDdndGR5NER5VVJQaUFfcUtFeEItVmFiblE&single=true&gid=5&output=html&widget=true'></iframe>


<p>Take another look at the data of murder by weapon type. Notice what&rsquo;s missing? Assault rifles. They barely chart &ndash; to the point that where to measure them they have to get included into the rifles group.  Let&rsquo;s actually chart that data to get a better visual representation of what that data is telling us.</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://fusion94.org//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js"> {"dataSourceUrl":"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0AizXDsCEsDdndGR5NER5VVJQaUFfcUtFeEItVmFiblE&transpose=0&headers=0&range=A4%3AB19&gid=3&pub=1","options":{"titleTextStyle":{"bold":true,"color":"#000","fontSize":"14"},"legendTextStyle":{"color":"#000000","fontSize":"10"},"animation":{"duration":0},"backgroundColor":{"fill":"#ffffff"},"colors":["#3366CC","#DC3912","#FF9900","#109618","#990099","#0099C6","#DD4477","#66AA00","#B82E2E","#316395","#994499","#22AA99","#AAAA11","#6633CC","#E67300","#8B0707","#651067","#329262","#5574A6","#3B3EAC","#B77322","#16D620","#B91383","#F4359E","#9C5935","#A9C413","#2A778D","#668D1C","#BEA413","#0C5922","#743411"],"width":1675,"is3D":false,"pieSliceText":"value","hAxis":{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"maxValue":null},"vAxes":[{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"maxValue":null},{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"maxValue":null}],"pieHole":"0.25","title":"Murder Victims by Weapon: 2007-2011","booleanRole":"certainty","width":675,"height":475,"legend":"left"},"state":{},"view":{},"isDefaultVisualization":true,"chartType":"PieChart","chartName":"Chart 2"} </script>


<p>Rifles account for 1,874 homicides from 2007-2011 out of a total of  68,720. That accounts to be 2.73%.  Now how  many of those 1,874 homicided were commited by an &lsquo;&ldquo;assault rifle&rsquo;&rdquo;? Well we really don&rsquo;t know. But let&rsquo;s extrapolate some raw numbers.</p>

<p>A November 2012 <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32842.pdf">Congressional Research Service report</a> found that, as of 2009, there were approximately 310 million firearms in the United States: 114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns.</p>

<p>In 2009, in a declaration made as part of the court case Heller v. District of Columbia, which challenged D.C.’s assault weapons ban, NRA research coordinator Mark Overstreet reported that, from 1986 to 2007, at least 1,626,525 AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles were produced and not exported from the United States. Overstreet suggested that you could use trends in NICS background checks to project future sales of AR-15-style rifles. As of Nov. 30, 2012, the total number of NICS background checks increased by 50.4 percent since the end of 2007. If the number of AR-15 rifles increased similarly, then that means there are at least 2,446,294 AR-15 rifles currently available in the United States.</p>

<p>These data only include firearms manufactured in the United States. In his declaration, Overstreet notes that, since 1986, “U.S.-made firearms have accounted for roughly three-fourths of all new firearms available on the commercial market in the United States.” So if you increase the above number to account for foreign-made, AR-15-style rifles, you get 3,261,725 total rifles.</p>

<p>Overstreet derived his numbers by examining the sales figures of companies that only produced AR-15-style rifles. He didn’t include sales data from America’s three largest gunmakers—Remington, Smith &amp; Wesson, and Sturm-Ruger—because these three produce multiple lines of rifles, and he couldn’t break down the data.</p>

<p> Let’s estimate those figures on our own.</p>

<p>According to Sturm-Ruger’s 2011 annual report, sales of rifles accounted for $83.4 million in revenue that year out of $324.2 million in total net firearms sales—about 26 percent of revenue. Sturm-Ruger produced 1,114,700 firearms in 2011. Assuming that every gun cost the same amount—this is certainly incorrect, but we’re just making a back-of-the-envelope calculation here—26 percent of 1,114,700 is roughly 290,000 rifles. According to Overstreet, AR-15s accounted for 14.4 percent of rifles produced in 2007. If that statistic remains true, then Sturm-Ruger produced close to 42,000 AR-15-style rifles in 2011. Walk that number back through the years, and extrapolate it out to the other two manufacturers, and you’re possibly looking at anywhere from 500,000 to 700,000 more AR-15-style rifles.</p>

<p>Add everything together, make all the necessary caveats, carry the two, and we reach the conclusion that there are somewhere around 3,750,000 AR-15-type rifles in the United States today.</p>

<p>If we round up once more that means that there are close to 4 million assault weapons in the U.S., which amounts to roughly 1.29% of the total gun stock of 310,000,000 firearms.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>If we accept the above numbers as not wildly inaccurate then we can extrapolate that approximately 1.29% of  all homicides that occured between 2007-2011 were at the hands of someone wielding an assault rifle. This comes out to be 24.17 people during that span or 4.83 a year.</p>

<p>In comparison, during that same time period, 4,058 people were beat to death by hands, fists and feet. Or approximately 812 people per year. This means that you&rsquo;re approximately 168 times more likely to be beaten to death by someone using their hands, fists and feet than to be killed with an assault rifle.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s just say for the sake of argument that 50% of Homicides committed using a rifle were &lsquo;&ldquo;assault rifles&rsquo;&rdquo;. This comes to equal approximately 187.4 homicides per year over that 5 year term or 1.36% of all Homicides.</p>

<p>In reality you&rsquo;re:</p>

<ul>
<li>1,365 times more likely to be murdered with a handgun</li>
<li>370 times more likely to be murdered with a knife</li>
<li>120 tiimes more likely to be murdered with a blunt object</li>
<li>84 times more likely to be murdered with a shotgun</li>
<li>19.35 times more likely to be murdered by fire</li>
<li>8.8 times more likely to be murdered through the use of narcotics</li>
<li>1.75 times more likely to be murdered through the use of poison</li>
<li>1.25 times more likely to be murdered through the use of explosives</li>
</ul>


<p>At least that&rsquo;s what the numbers tell us.</p>

<p>In reality, Assault weapons are not the weapons of choice among drug dealers, gang members or criminals in general. Assault weapons are used in about one-fifth of one percent (.20%) of all violent crimes and about one percent in overall gun crimes.</p>

<h3>The 2nd Amendment</h3>

<p>Some people will argue that since the founders and framers of the Constitution only had access to muzzle loading black powder rifles then that&rsquo;s literally what they meant, and therefore the 2nd Amendment no longer applies.</p>

<p>This is a seriously malformed argument on many points, but there are people who earnestly posit such a statement. Of course we could preface the beginning of any statement accordingly in an attempt to disregard any of the rights in the Constitution.</p>

<p>For example: let&rsquo;s apply that logic to the 1st Amendment.</p>

<blockquote>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</blockquote>


<p>Due to the lack of electronics during the time that the Constitution was written we can state that your right to freedom of speech only applies to spoken word or printed word when that printed word was hand written since the framers didn&rsquo;t have a word processor, ink jet/laser printers, email, cellular phones, facebook and twitter.</p>

<p>How ridiculous does that argument sound now?</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s apply some of that logic to the 5th Amendment.</p>

<blockquote>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.</blockquote>


<p>Now the 5th Amendment deals with Double Jeopardy and the wording states &lsquo;&ldquo;nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb&rsquo;&rdquo;. Since some crimes don&rsquo;t have the punishment of losing either your life or a limb does that mean you can be tried over and over again until the government is happy with  the outcome? Of course it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Like it or not the 2nd Amendment is law. The law cannot be ignored because one considers the practices of lawmakers at the time disagreeable or immoral by today&rsquo;s standards. By the same reasoning, if our President or members of Congress commit immoral acts, is the legislation they passed suddenly invalid? No it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Whatever the vices and imperfections of the Founders, they were masters at establishing a republican form of government.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There is a chance that if you are trying to change someone&rsquo;s mind about guns by spouting statistics about gun violence or gun accidents or crimes thwarted by guns that you might as well be manipulating your butt cheeks to modulate your farts into a Skrillex track; sure, it may impress a crowd at parties, but it&rsquo;s not going to change anyone&rsquo;s mind. This is what people who aren&rsquo;t from America, or who grew up somewhere like Berkeley or whatever, don&rsquo;t get: America&rsquo;s love of guns has nothing to do with actually using them.</p>

<p>The huge gap suggests President Obama’s call for new firearm restrictions would do little to reduce the number people murdered each year – even if a reluctant Congress were to pass all his requests. His proposals don’t really addresss handguns.</p>

<p>Assault rifles are not America&rsquo;s biggest problem. Elimination of assault rifles won&rsquo;t address the problem as that will only address 1.29% of the issue. What about the other 98.71% of homicides? Are they now acceptable by comparision?</p>

<p>No they aren&rsquo;t. So pull your head out of your ass and let&rsquo;s start addressing the problem (which is people) and not the tool.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So for whatever reason Google has chosen to hide the developer settings in the latest version of Jelly Bean. Here&rsquo;s how to get them back.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a pretty easy way to re-enable developer setttings and here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the settings menu, and scroll down to <code>"About phone."</code> Tap it.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the bottom again, where you see <code>"Build number."</code> (Your build number may vary from ours here.)</li>
<li>Tap it seven (7) times. After the third tap, you&rsquo;ll see a dialog that says you&rsquo;re four taps away from being a developer. Keep on tapping, and eventually, you&rsquo;ve got the developer settings back.</li>

    <updated>2013-01-24T23:40:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/01/24/kandan-an-open-source-alternative-to-hipchat</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="info">Say Goodbye to inefficient meetinngs and email threads. Get your team off of AIM, Google Talk, Skype or IRC.</div>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Today I&rsquo;d like to introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/kandanapp/kandan">Kandan</a> an Open Source alternative to HipChat.</p>

<p>What is Kandan? Kandan is a private chat service for your company or team. You can invite colleagues to share ideas and files in a persistent group chat room or rooms.</p>

<p>Unlike HipChat or other alternatives, Kandan is completely Open Source and can be hosted internally or externally by your organization or by a third party.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Kandan was originally developed by <a href="http://cloudfuji.com/">Cloudfuji</a> and they started development on it back on March 6th of 2012. Development went pretty fast and furious until about June 4th of 2012. After that there wasn&rsquo;t another commit to the repository until some pull requests came in during the month of January of 2013.</p>

<p>In talking with the team at Cloudfuji both <a href="http://jamesrgifford.com/">James Gifford</a> and I agreed to take over maintenance of the project.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>These are features that work out of the box on any provider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy deploy to CloudFoundry, Heroku, dotCloud, etc.</li>
<li>Collaborative team chat</li>
<li>Unlimited channels</li>
<li>Embed formats for images and youtube videos with requests for others (twitter, facebook, g+, etc.)</li>
<li>Synchronized sound player &ndash; play any audio-tag compatible url for the whole channel (Pending :P)</li>
<li>/me command!</li>
<li>Highly extensible plugin format</li>
</ul>


<h3>Get Involved</h3>

<p>Since Kandan is a fully open-source app, we would appreciate if you dive in and start adding features, fixing bugs (what bugs?), and cleaning up the code.</p>

<p>Make sure you check out these resources as well.</p>

    <link href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/01/16/clahub-clas-done-right/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-16T08:06:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/01/16/clahub-clas-done-right</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="error">IANAL: The post below is based on my experiences in dealing with Open Source projects from a contributor standpoint and as a benevolent dictator.</div>


<h3>Background</h3>

<p>First of all, what exactly is a Contributor License Agreement (hereafter referred to as <strong>CLA</strong>)?</p>

<p>Most of us that have been employed as Software Engineers by corporations are already intimately familiar with <strong>CLAs</strong> although in the corporate world they are generally called a <em>&ldquo;Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement&rdquo;</em>. In many ways a <strong>CLA</strong> is nothing more than that but specifically geared towards Open Source projects.</p>

<p>A <strong>CLA</strong> is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the <strong>project</strong> you&rsquo;re contributing to and are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works. This means that should there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and ownership of any particular piece of code, then that <strong>project</strong> has the necessary forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this contribution.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The <strong>CLA</strong> also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.</p>

<h3>What Needs To Be In A CLA</h3>

<p>The <strong>CLA</strong> needs to grant rights to a project’s owner (or owning body/organization) that enable the release of the software in question. In the simplest scenario, a <strong>CLA</strong> is not, in fact, used at all; the contributor simply assigns the copyright to the project owner. When done properly, the contributor will need to sign a statement to that effect.</p>

<p>Thus the contributor needs to &ndash; at minimum &ndash; grant the rights that will be granted to the project’s owner in the distribution licence. When granting rights it is common to grant a very broad range of rights. This is in order to avoid the need to return to the contributor for authorization to take a desired action with their contribution, such as releasing under a different licence.</p>

<p>A <strong>CLA</strong> should also contain personal information about the person that signs it, such as a complete name and mailing address. You should be aware of the potential implications that storing this information could have in terms of the data protection law in your country and ensure that you have a Privacy Policy in place to deal with this.</p>

<h3>Recording CLAs</h3>

<p>It is very, very important to record the assignment of copyright or grant of rights for each contribution or from each contributor. This means an Open Source project <strong>must</strong> track and record <strong>CLAs</strong> submitted by contributors. It is generally best to have a <strong>CLA</strong> signed and submitted to project administrators for permanent record prior to the contributor submitting his/her contributions.</p>

<h3>Maintaining CLAs</h3>

<p>Maintaining <strong>CLAs</strong> can be challenging but overall it is not a difficult task. It does increase the effort required to make and accept third-party contributions. Most contributors will start small; i.e., they will provide a simple bug-fix, or a spelling correction. The temptation is there to bypass the requirement of a <strong>CLA</strong> for small contributions.</p>

<p>This begs the the question, <em>&ldquo;Must a <strong>CLA</strong> be in place for every contribution?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>For small contributions, the risk of loss from legal action can be small. For larger chunks of code/documentation, incorporating major functionality, the risks would be much, much higher.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s really up to the project owners and stakeholders on which contributions they chose to accept with and without a <strong>CLA</strong>.</p>

<h3>So who uses a CLA</h3>

<p>So what notable Open Source projects are using a <strong>CLA</strong>? Here are just a few.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.canonical.com/contributors">Canonical</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Licenses/CLA">Fedora</a></li>
<li><a href="http://source.android.com/source/cla-individual.html">Android</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mono-project.com/FAQ:_Licensing">Mono</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt">Apache</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org/cla.html">NodeJS</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Methods of Recording a CLA</h3>

<p>There are many ways to record and maintain a <strong>CLA</strong>. Some projects require that you print out, complete and sign a document then mail that document back to them. Some projects allow for scanning in a signed agreement then emailing in PDF form to a specific email address while other projects have embraced contributors signing electronically.</p>

<p>Smaller Open Source projects have used electronic signature providers such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.echosign.adobe.com/en/home.html">Echosign</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.docusign.com/">DocuSign</a></li>
</ul>


<p>While larger projects have rolled their own online solution.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://forms.canonical.com/contributor/">Canonical</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org/cla.html">NodeJS</a></li>
</ul>


<p>You can also use <a href="http://www.harmonyagreements.org/">Harmony Agreements</a> to assist you in selecting the right <strong>CLA</strong> for your Open Source project.</p>

<h3>My experience with CLAs</h3>

<p>For a year, I was the Director of Developer Relations at <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com">Appcelerator</a> and part of my job was to be the default company representative and signer for the <strong>CLA</strong> we had in place. We happened to use <a href="https://www.echosign.adobe.com/en/home.html">Echosign</a> as our electronic signing tool of choice. As I haven&rsquo;t used Echosign (plus they&rsquo;ve been purchased by Adobe since then) in over a year I won&rsquo;t go into details as to whether or not it&rsquo;s any good.</p>

<h4>Appcelerator CLA Workflow</h4>

<p>At Appcelerator a vast majority of our work was Open Source and was hosted in public repositories over on <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator">GitHub</a>. The workflow pretty much operated like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork the project.</li>
<li>Make one or more well commented and clean commits to the forked repository.</li>
<li>Perform a pull request in github&rsquo;s web interface.</li>
<li>Project stakeholder would review the pull request and choose to accept/reject.</li>
<li>If project stakeholder chose to accept, stakeholder would email me to verify if we had a signed <strong>CLA</strong> on file for the contributor.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d logon to Echosign and verify if there was a <strong>CLA</strong> on file for said contributor.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d email the project stakeholder and let him/her know if there was or wasn&rsquo;t a <strong>CLA</strong> on file.</li>
<li>Project stakeholder would accept the pull request if we had a <strong>CLA</strong> on file or if we didn&rsquo;t they&rsquo;d reach out to the contributor and get them to sign the <strong>CLA</strong>.</li>
<li>Once the contributor signed the <strong>CLA</strong> we had to go through steps 6-8 all over again.</li>
</ol>


<p>As you can imagine, this was rather inefficient and created quite a bit of friction at times. Which brings me to <a href="https://github.com/jasonm/clahub">CLAHub</a></p>

<h3>CLAHub</h3>

<p>I found about <a href="https://github.com/jasonm/clahub">CLAHub</a> while perusing the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/Octopress-Sites">Octopress Sites Wiki</a> and checking out other people&rsquo;s <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> installs and themes. One of the sites I visited was the website of <a href="http://jayunit.net/">Jason Morrison</a> who is the author of CLAHub.</p>

<p>I read through his <a href="http://jayunit.net/2013/01/09/clahub-easy-contributor-agreements-on-github/">blog post</a> and fell in love with the idea and the concept.</p>

<p><strong>This is how Jason describes it:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>With CLAHub and an open source project on GitHub you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sign in with GitHub and create a CLA for your project.</li>
<li>Ask contributors to sign in with GitHub to electronically sign the CLA.</li>
<li>See on each pull request whether the contributors have all signed your CLA. This uses the handy Commit Status API, similar to what CI tools do.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As a bonus Jason has released it as Open Source under the permissive <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonm/clahub/master/LICENSE">MIT license</a>.</p>

<p>To find out more about the project then please visit these links:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.clahub.com/">CLAHub Site</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonm/clahub">GitHub Code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jasonm/clahub/issues">GitHub Issues</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jayunit.net/2013/01/09/clahub-easy-contributor-agreements-on-github/">Jason&rsquo;s Original Blog Post</a></li>
</ul>


<p>One thing to note is that CLAHub currently only works for <strong>public</strong> repositories and <strong>NOT private</strong> repositories.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If CLAHub had been available during my time at Appcelerator we definitely would have used it as it removes almost <strong>ALL</strong> of the friction points listed above.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a developer with an Open Source project hosted on GitHub or an organization that&rsquo;s doing the same then you should really take the time to evaluate CLAHub as it just integrates nicely with the existing tools and methods that you are more than likely already using.</p>

    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/01/13/firefox-os-app-day-silicon-valley</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a software developer interested in web technologies then you should really consider participating in <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement/Developer_Engagement/FirefoxAppDays">Firefox OS App Days</a>, a worldwide set of 20+ hack days organized by <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> to help you get started developing apps for the all new and shiny <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/11/firefox-os-video-presentations-and-slides-on-the-os-webapis-hacking-and-writing-apps/">Firefox OS</a>.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://fusion94.org/images/blog/firefox/firefoxOS-app-days.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be attending the <a href="http://firefoxosappday-siliconvalley.eventbrite.com/">Silicon Valley Event</a> on Saturday, January 19, 2013 being held at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.</p>

<p>This should be a really good opportunity to start creating applications for the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/">Firefox Marketplace</a> and the upcoming Firefox OS phone.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As the folks from <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> describe it:</p>

<blockquote><p>At each App Day event, you’ll have the opportunity to learn, hack and celebrate Firefox OS, Mozilla’s open source operating system for the mobile web. Technologists and developers from Mozilla will present tools and technology built to extend and support the Web platform, including mobile Web APIs to access device hardware features such as the accelerometer. We’ll also show you how to use the browser-based Firefox OS Simulator to view and test mobile apps on the desktop.</p>

<p>Firefox OS App Days are a chance to kick start creation of apps for the Firefox Marketplace, and represent a great opportunity to build new apps or optimize existing HTML5 apps for Firefox OS, as well as demo your projects to an audience of peers, tech leaders and innovators.</p></blockquote>

<h4>What to bring:</h4>

<p>Bring your Linux, Mac or Windows development machine and device(s). Mozilla will provide everything else.</p>

<h4>What to build:</h4>

<p>The Firefox Marketplace is looking for open web apps that work well on mobile for Firefox OS and Firefox for Android. Mozilla is interested in all kinds of web apps. You can bring an HTML5 app that you’ve started and want to continue, finish, polish, or just present.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-13T07:10:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/01/13/howto-tweet-new-posts-in-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to a <a href="http://prydoni.us/blog/2012/04/29/tweet-new-posts-in-octopress/">blog post</a> from <a href="http://prydoni.us/blog/">Adnan Abdulhussein</a>, I can now auto-tweet new blog posts on my <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> blog.</p>

<p>I used his original blog post as a guideline but his method was a bit dated and here&rsquo;s the process I used to get this functionality working.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The basic idea works this way, when you create a post it prints the tweet message you give it and a link to the post in a <code>tweet_queue</code> file. When you deploy, it simply reads this file and tweets what’s in there line-by-line. This also means you can create multiple posts at a time, and they will all be tweeted at the same time when you deploy you blog.</p>

<h4>Create an application on Twitter</h4>

<p>Head over to <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new">https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new</a>, sign in and create a Twitter application for your blog.</p>

<p>In <em>Settings:</em> ensure <em>read</em> and <em>write</em> access is <strong>enabled</strong>.</p>

<p>In <em>Details:</em> take note of the following details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consumer Key</li>
<li>Consumer Secret</li>
<li>Access Token</li>
<li>Access Token Secret</li>
</ul>


<h4>Install the gem</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be using the Twitter gem to update statues. So first things first, so go ahead and put this in your <code>Gemfile</code> in the development group::</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Installing the twitter gem </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'twitter'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then from a terminal run <code>bundle install</code> to install the gem.</p>

<h4>Configure Twitter</h4>

<p>Open up your <code>Rakefile</code> and add the following up near the top with the other requires:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Adding Rakefile requires </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>require "twitter"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>While you have the <code>Rakefile</code> open add the following lines after the <code>server_port</code> line:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Configuring Rakefile for Twitter </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Twitter config (for tweeting posts)
</span><span class='line'>Twitter.configure do |config|
</span><span class='line'>  config.consumer_key = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY"
</span><span class='line'>  config.consumer_secret = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET"
</span><span class='line'>  config.oauth_token = "YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN"
</span><span class='line'>  config.oauth_token_secret = "YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET"
</span><span class='line'>end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># URL of your blog e.g. http://fusion94.org/blog/
</span><span class='line'># MAKE SURE THERE IS A TRAILING SLASH, otherwise the linking won't work
</span><span class='line'>blog_url = "YOUR_BLOG_URL"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Replacing <code>YOUR_*</code> with the details from your Twitter app.</p>

<p>Make sure there is a trailing slash (slash at the end of the URL) for the <code>blog_url</code>. It needs this because it appends the date-name combo of the post to form the URL of the post.</p>

<h4>Modify the ‘new_post’ rake task</h4>

<p>Look for the <code>:new_post</code> rake task in the <code>Rakefile</code>. this should be around lines 106 or so. Replace the task with the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Configuring new_post rake task </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>

<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
<span class='line-number'>21</span>
<span class='line-number'>22</span>
<span class='line-number'>23</span>
<span class='line-number'>24</span>
<span class='line-number'>25</span>
<span class='line-number'>26</span>
<span class='line-number'>27</span>
<span class='line-number'>28</span>
<span class='line-number'>29</span>
<span class='line-number'>30</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># usage rake new_post[my-new-post] or rake new_post['my new post'] or rake new_post (defaults to "new-post")
</span><span class='line'>desc "Begin a new post in #{source_dir}/#{posts_dir}"
</span><span class='line'>task :new_post, :title, :tweet do |t, args|
</span><span class='line'>  raise "### You haven't set anything up yet. First run `rake install` to set up an Octopress theme." unless File.directory?(source_dir)

</span><span class='line'>    abort("rake aborted!") if ask("#{filename} already exists. Do you want to overwrite?", ['y', 'n']) == 'n'
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>  puts "Creating new post: #{filename}"
</span><span class='line'>  open(filename, 'w') do |post|
</span><span class='line'>    post.puts "---"
</span><span class='line'>    post.puts "layout: post"
</span><span class='line'>    post.puts "title: \"#{title.gsub(/&/,'&amp;')}\""
</span><span class='line'>    post.puts "date: #{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}"
</span><span class='line'>    post.puts "comments: true"
</span><span class='line'>    post.puts "categories: "
</span><span class='line'>    post.puts "---"
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>  tweet = args.tweet
</span><span class='line'>  if not tweet == ''
</span><span class='line'>    # add to twitter status queue
</span><span class='line'>    puts 'Adding post to tweet queue, it will be tweeted after deploying.'
</span><span class='line'>    open('tweet_queue', 'a') do |file|
</span><span class='line'>      file.puts "#{tweet} - #{blog_url}#{Time.now.strftime('%Y/%m/%d')}/#{title.to_url}/"
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you already have a modified task, the only changes are the task declaration <code>(task :new_post, :title, :tweet do |t, args|)</code> and the last few lines starting with <code>tweet = args.tweet.</code></p>

<h4>Setup tweet on deploy</h4>

<p>Look for the <code>:deploy task</code> in the <code>Rakefile</code> this should be around lines 232 or so. Replace the task with the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Confguring deploy to tweet </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>22</span>
<span class='line-number'>23</span>
<span class='line-number'>24</span>
<span class='line-number'>25</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>desc "Default deploy task"
</span><span class='line'>task :deploy do
</span><span class='line'>  # Check if preview posts exist, which should not be published
</span><span class='line'>  if File.exists?(".preview-mode")
</span><span class='line'>    puts "## Found posts in preview mode, regenerating files ..."
</span><span class='line'>    File.delete(".preview-mode")
</span><span class='line'>    Rake::Task[:generate].execute
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  Rake::Task[:copydot].invoke(source_dir, public_dir)
</span><span class='line'>  Rake::Task["#{deploy_default}"].execute
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  # Tweet
</span><span class='line'>  next if not File.exists? 'tweet_queue'
</span><span class='line'>  puts "Tweeting..."
</span><span class='line'>  client = Twitter::Client.new
</span><span class='line'>  open('tweet_queue', 'r') do |file|
</span><span class='line'>    while (line = file.gets)
</span><span class='line'>      puts "Tweeting '#{line.gsub("\n", "")}' for @#{client.current_user.screen_name}..."
</span><span class='line'>      Twitter.update line
</span><span class='line'>    end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>  puts "Deleting queue..."
</span><span class='line'>  rm 'tweet_queue'
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or indeed just add the last couple of lines starting with <code># Tweet</code>.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>The only change here is you’ll need to specify a separate message for the tweet when you create the post. This is the best way to give you the option of choosing whether you want to tweet the post or not. It also allows you to add @’s and #’s to the tweet message separately from the post title.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<p>The first section is the title of the post while the second section is the tweet that will go out along with the URL to the blog post.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>rake new_post usage </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake new_post["HowTo Tweet New Posts in Octopress","HowTo Tweet New Posts in Octopress @twitter"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And here&rsquo;s the message generated after the <code>rake new_post</code> task is run.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>rake new_post message </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir -p source/_posts
</span><span class='line'>Creating new post: source/_posts/2013-01-13-howto-tweet-new-posts-in-octopress.markdown
</span><span class='line'>Adding post to tweet queue, it will be tweeted after deploying.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now all that&rsquo;s left to do is create your post and then run <code>rake generate &amp;&amp; rake deploy</code>. Your post will be deployed and your tweet will be sent.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. Pretty simple eh? Have fun tweeting and blogging from Octopress.</p>

The <a href="http://wiki.openrov.com">OpenROV Wiki</a> is really starting to fill out: <a href="http://wiki.openrov.com/index.php/Assembly#Step_by_step_instructions">Step by Step Instructions</a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the best place to start. The goal is for each section of the build to have:</p>

<li>Tools/Materials/Parts</li>
<li>Video/Photos/Explanation</li>
<li>Test (to make sure it works and you don&rsquo;t move on until it&rsquo;s functioning correctly)</li>
<li>Troubleshooting</li>
</ol>


<p>The endcap process is a good example of what we are striving for: <a href="http://wiki.openrov.com/index.php/Assembling_and_Gluing_the_end_caps">Endcap Assembly</a></p>

<p>The most important thing to remember: the OpenROV is a work-in-progress. If you have a question, or a doubt, or an idea: SPEAK UP! The only way this project gets better is if it continues to be tweaked and improved by everyone who works on it. If you think you&rsquo;ve got a better way of explaining something &ndash; let&rsquo;s discuss it!</p>

<p>Also, we&rsquo;re planning on hosting build days at our small office in Berkeley. We&rsquo;ll be streaming the build days from our new <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/116561282178440599596">OpenROV Community page on G+</a> so anyone around the world can tune in and ask questions (all videos will be archived on Youtube).</p>

<p>The first build day &ndash; the acrylic structure &ndash; will be on Saturday, January 19th starting at 12pm PST.</p>

<p>If you want to join us in-person in Berkeley, please send David Lang an email at: david @ openrov.com</p>

<p><strong>What is OpenROV</strong></p>

<p>OpenROV is a  Do It Yourself telerobotics community centered around underwater exploration and education. We have developed a low-cost telerobotic submarine that can be built with mostly off-the-shelf parts. The goal of OpenROV is to democratize exploration by allowing anyone to explore and study underwater environments.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a short video of it in action.</p>

    <link href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/01/11/recent-comments-as-an-asides/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-11T16:39:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/01/11/recent-comments-as-an-asides</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This short tutorial will teach you in creating a &ldquo;Recent Comments&rdquo; asides for the Octopress sidebar if you&rsquo;re using Disqus as your commenting system.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Let’s create a new aside. Create a new file named <code>recent_comments.html</code> under <code>source/_includes/custom/asides</code></p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the following code</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>recent_comments.html </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;section&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Recent Comments<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;dsq-recentcomments&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;dsq-widget&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://disqus.com/forums/fusion94org/recent_comments_widget.js?hide_avatars=1&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here are the parameters you can use for comments :</p>

<ul>
<li>hide_avatars : hides the avatar in comments (values : 0, 1)</li>
<li>num_items : number of comments to show</li>
<li>excerpt_length : number of characters to show for each comment</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the aside to <code>_config.yml</code></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>default_asides: [custom/asides/links.html, asides/recent_posts.html, custom/asides/recent_comments.html, asides/github.html, asides/twitter.html, asides/delicious.html, asides/pinboard.html, asides/googleplus.html]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Rebuild your site</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake generate && rake deploy</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
