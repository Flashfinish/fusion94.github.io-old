  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So we&rsquo;ve announced our Board of Advisors for Damage Studios. Here&rsquo;s a copy of the press release.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Damage Studios Incorporated Forms Board of Advisors with Three Key Appointments</strong></p>

<p>Advisory Team to Bolster Damage&rsquo;s Capabilities with Expertise in Content, Corporate Strategy, Financial Management and Venture Capital</p>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10 /PRNewswire/ &mdash; Damage Studios Incorporated, a game studio working on Rekonstruction, a next generation massively multiplayer online game, today announces the formation of its Board of Advisors with Wil Wheaton, Todd Choy and Scott Rafer as the inaugural members.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Big Business and Hollywood beginning to invest heavily into massive multiplayer online games, an industry projected to grow to USD$2.7 billion in 2006,&rdquo; notes Tony Guntharp, Damage president &amp; CEO, &ldquo;it is invaluable to have Wil, with his knowledge of Hollywood; Todd, with his extensive financial experience; and Scott, with his venture capital track record, join us in an advisory capacity.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Todd G. Choy</strong></p>

<p>As the Chief Financial Officer at Medem, Mr. Choy oversees the accounting, finance, human resources, and administrative operations. Mr. Choy also acts as the Company&rsquo;s Assistant Secretary and Treasurer for the Board of Directors. He most recently assisted in raising three rounds of venture capital funding for planet U Inc., an Internet consumer promotions company. Previously, Mr. Choy held various Director positions at The Gap and Nestle USA. Mr. Choy is a member of the Board of Advisors of Angry Coffee Inc., a digital music firm.</p>

<p>Mr. Choy holds a Master of Business Administration in Finance from San Francisco State and a Bachelor of Science from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<p><strong>Scott Rafer</strong></p>

<p>Currently Mr. Rafer is the chairman of WiFinder, a wireless networking services company.

Other positions held by Mr. Rafer include President of FotoNation, General Manager of Internet Products and Services for Kodak and Vice President of Operations for Torque Systems. Mr. Rafer started his career in technology as an analyst at the investment bank Needham &amp; Company in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. Rafer is a graduate of the Jerome Fisher Program at the University of Pennsylvania, a double degree program jointly offered by the Wharton School of Business and the Moore School of Engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Wil Wheaton</strong></p>

<p>Wil is currently a writer and performer with the ACME Comedy Theatre, and was recently called &ldquo;rather remarkable&rdquo; by LA Weekly. Upcoming roles include the romantic lead in the dark comedy &ldquo;Jane White is Sick and Twisted&rdquo; and a guest starring lead on PAX TV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Twice In A Lifetime&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So I spent about 3 &frac12; hours at the <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/">California Academy of Sciences</a> today. I spent most of my time in the Natural History Museum and the Steinhart Aquarium. Saw several very cool exhibits.</p>

<p>The Department of Ichthyology had an exhibit where they had x-rayed several types and species of fish. It was way cool and wasn`t expected.</p>

<p>The Steinhart Aquarium also had several cool things. One of which was the display of Burmese Vine Snakes. The aquarium was the first in the world to display these snakes. These snakes are rear fanged and venomous although their venom isn`t that dangerous to humans. They are also unique in the fact that while they are Vine/Tree Dwelling snakes they primarily eat fish and hunt from low hanging vines and limbs. It was interesting watching them hunt.</p>

<p>The Aquarium had several other snakes that were interesting to view. They had 2 Gaboon Vipers from Africa on display. It was the first time I had seen the Gaboon up close and they are very beautiful snakes.</p>

<p>Gaboons can reach a length of 4 feet on average, but lengths of 7 feet and more have been recorded. These animals will weigh about 8 to 10 kg and have a head-size of approximately 5 inches and matching fangs of 2 inches. Gaboons are the largest of the Vipers and is one of three members of the African Giant Vipers Group.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great day. I can<code>t believe that I</code>ve lived here in the Bay Area for 6 years now and just got around to visiting the Academy. If you visit San Francisco or live in the area and are interested in Reptiles I highly recommend visiting the Academy.</p>

There are a couple of areas that still need to be filled in but I will get those up and running ASAP.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>2001 is finally over. Thank God. For those that didnt know, 2001 was a banner year for me. Lets see&hellip; I got laid off from VA Linux Systems in September. Then my mother was diagnosed with cancer. Sounds like fun doesnt it ? No worries though, VA was getting to the point where it wasnt a great place to work and my mother is on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>I appreciate everyone who has sent emails and notes regarding my mothers health if I forgot to respond to you I&rsquo;m sorry about that.</p>

<p>The job situation is startng to look up for me at the moment, I have two really promising things to follow up on this week and one of them will pan out.</p>

<p>One other thing, this is a new design, Boris has been bitching about it so I changed it.</p>

<p>So Boris: Sod off you wanker.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I was up all night playing Anarchy Online last night and was still playing this morning at 7:00am PST when the canadian called me on my cell. At first I was like wtf is he doing calling me at this time of the morning? When I answered the phone the first thing out of his mouth was &ldquo;turn on CNN&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So I did. And was amazed/shocked by what I was seeing. It was unbelievable. After a few minutes I was called him back to find out what was going on down south and he mentioned that him and mej were glued to the TV. I jumped on the bike  and hit 101 at about 120mph. I do believe that that&rsquo;s the fastest I&rsquo;ve ever made it from SF to San Jose.</p>

<p>I stayed down there all day watching CNN and a few other people came by throughout the day. All I can say is that I&rsquo;m saddened and shocked by the events that transpired today. I wonder how this is going to play out as someone&rsquo;s going to pay for this.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So today was the last day of Hardware/Software Engineering at <a href="http://valinux.com">VA Linux Systems</a>. A decision was made awhile back to exit the hardware business altogether so we all became dead weight to the company. This was not new news for those of us in engineering but it&rsquo;s still a difficult pill to swallow.</p>

<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever had to experience a layoff so it was especially difficult for me. On the upside was that the severance package that was offered was very very generous and that&rsquo;s going to help in the transition.</p>

<p>Working at VA was a once in a lifetime experience. I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ll ever get the opportunity to work with a team of such dedicated, talented and brilliant engineers ever again and that does in fact weigh heavily upon me.</p>

<p>Anyways I&rsquo;m rambling now. Time to take a break from work and other things and see what lies over the horizon.</p>
