  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Been a few day&rsquo;s since I&rsquo;ve written anything. I&rsquo;ve been fairly busy as of late due to preparing for the holidays and what not. So here&rsquo;s just a few things on my mind.</p>

<p>It looks as though I will be buying that house in Dallas. The people that are currently in it should be out by the first of February and I should be in shortly thereafter. It also appears that it&rsquo;s going to have to have the interior painted as well as having new carpet laid down. Oh well. At least I shouldn&rsquo;t have to do anything to the place for a bit. It&rsquo;s got a 2 car garage and I&rsquo;m already trying to figure out the best place to install a couple of racks worth of hardware. Since the garage is detached I&rsquo;m also going to have to run ethernet or fiber to the main house. I&rsquo;m also going to have to get the garage wired into the alarm system. I&rsquo;ll make plans around this over the holidays.</p>

<p>On a worrying note I located <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3234908.stm">this article about a 1991 Gulf War veteran who died in 2001</a> whose death has been linked back the the Gulf War. As a Gulf War veteran it&rsquo;s more or less concerning to me. Especially when I also locate <a href="http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/library/randrep/pb_paper/">reports</a> like this.</p>

<p>More thoughts on this tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Just random bits of cruftiness&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>I feel much better today. I was afraid that I was going to be useless for a couple of days afer the Surgery but I haven&rsquo;t had any issues at all related to it. This is very good and unexpected to be quiet honest. I&rsquo;m even back to eating normal foods today.</p>

<p>So <a href=""http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> just released 2 new Macs. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">20&#8221; Imac</a> in all it&rsquo;s sweetness, and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">Dual 1.8ghz G5</a>. I was considering the middle of the road G5 for the house but now have to rethink things with the addition on the 20&#8221; Imac. Decisions&hellip;Decisions.</p>

<p>Also to note is that there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/news.php?id=242">rumour</a> over on <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/">Apple Insider</a> that talks about a dual G4 Powerbook. This will probably happen right after I purchase a new Powerbook to replace this First-Generation that I use daily.</p>

<p>In other areas of news is anyone really suprised that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/19/jackson.ranch/index.html">Michael Jackson faces multiple counts of child molestation</a> ? I mean for god&rsquo;s sakes&hellip;.this isn&rsquo;t really news is it ?</p>

<p>Also to note is that <a href="http://www.sco.com/">SCO</a> <a href="http://www.atnewyork.com/news/article.php/3110981">plans to extend it&rsquo;s lawsuit to the BSD community</a>. The company has also had to <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/2003/Nov/11192003/business/112207.asp">hire bodyguards</a> to protect it&rsquo;s executive management team.</p>

<p>Lastly for the night is that <a href="http://dibona.org">Chris DiBona</a> (one of the other founders of <a href="http://damagestudios.com">Damage Studios</a>) has released another <a href="http://rekonstruction.com/topics.html?topic=2192">update</a> to the <a href="http://rekonstruction.com">Rekonstruction</a> Backstory. Give it a read if you get a chance. Also we should be converting all the mailman archives over to a RSS feed in the very near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Well it was far less painful than I imagined. Actually there was no pain at
all. After spending an hour and a half waiting the whole procedure took about 5
minutes. Typical isn&rsquo;t it. Plus I can&rsquo;t drink coffee for a couple of hours. So
if I bite your head off today I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;.it&rsquo;s the lack of caffeine. Now I get
to spend the next week or two worried about things such as Bone Spicules (sharp
bone edges), abscess, maxillary sinus troubles, and dry sockets.</p>

<p>Joy Joy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write more later today but for now I think I&rsquo;ll rest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Here&rsquo;s a couple of days worth of New, Rumblings and Grumblings.</p>

<p><b><i>Today&rsquo;s Best News</i></b>
So Arnold Schwarzenegger was sworn in today as California&rsquo;s Governor and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/17/elec04.schwarzenegger/index.html">immediately signed an order that rolled back a 300% increase in state vehicle registration fees</a>. This is very good news. Hard to tell how he&rsquo;s going to be overall but believe me, he can&rsquo;t be worse than Gray Davis. Of course Gary Coleman was a better option than Gray Davis.</p>

<p><b><i>Today&rsquo;s Sign that the Apocalypse is upon us</i></b>
Britney Spears <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,103251,00.html">insists</a> that she&rsquo;s a role model for young girls. If I ever have a daughter and she decides that she want&rsquo;s to model her life after Britney Spears then she&rsquo;s never ever leaving the house.</p>

<p><b>Traveling over the Holidays and Houses</b>
Speaking of houses&hellip;.I&rsquo;m trying to buy a house located in/about Dallas, Texas. I should know more about it later this week. If I get the house I&rsquo;ll probably move back to Dallas sometime after the <a href="http://www.macworldexpo.com/">Macworld Conference &amp; Expo</a> in January. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to it. (Thanks to Kathy and Natalie btw)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be heading to my grandmother&rsquo;s in Alabama (joy joy) for the Thanksgiving holidays and then heading out to my Aunt &amp; Uncles place in Dallas for Christmas. Did I mention that I hate traveling ??</p>

<p><b>Sports Related Hypocrisy of the Day</b>
Also, does anyone else find <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/writers/phil_taylor/11/17/hot_button/?cnn=yes">this</a> disturbing ? It just goes to prove the blatant hypocrisy that&rsquo;s rampant in the Management Team of the NFL.</p>

<p><b>Paul Thurrott is a moron</b>
Paul Thurrott claims that he&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2003_10_12_archive.htm#106606305212392022">&ldquo;general tech enthusiast&rdquo;</a> and not a &ldquo;Microsoft Fan&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;ve ever read any of his stuff you&rsquo;d have to be mentally retarded to believe that.</p>

<p>I also love seeing him get all worked up over a <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2003_11_02_archive.htm#106789163071999290">Security Update</a> to OS X (10.3 Panther) after only 2 weeks since release. Well Paul, that security update alsmost bothered me until I realized that Internet Explorer 6 under Windows XP has had more security updates that I&rsquo;ve every had for OS X. So, in the words of my british friends, &ldquo;Sod Off you Wanker&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a few links to his 2 big sites so you can read more about him.
<a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/">Personal Site</a>
<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/">Work Site</a></p>

<p><b>Games, Games, and More Games&hellip;</b>
So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been playing alot lately (other than AO).
<a href="http://www.callofduty.com">Call of Duty</a>
<a href="http://mohaa.ea.com">MOHAA: Breakthrough</a>
<a href="http://www.americasarmy.com">America&rsquo;s Army 2.0</a></p>

<p>Let me start by saying that Call of Duty is probably one of the prettiest First Person Shooters I&rsquo;ve seen. The Maps are all very complex and nice and the Particle Effects and Textures are amazing. I&rsquo;ve been able to run at 1600x1200x32bit and still pull 90fps. Simply amazing. My only real beef so far with the game is that the weapon accuracy in Multi-Player mode is a huge downgrade from Single-Player Mode and that there appears to be rampant cheating going on in Multi-Player mode. Come on guys, get the damn thing PunkBuster Enabled or work with the CI guys to get CI working. If you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re going to end up with a great game and not many players.</p>

<p>The MOHAA: Breakthrough expansion pack was/is pretty much as expected. The whole MOHAA series (for the PC at least) has been rock solid and has captured my attention since release. The weapons are accurate, the gameplay fast and furious and Single-Player vs. Multi-Player mode works identical for the most part.</p>

<p>America&rsquo;s Army 2.0 is probably the <i>second</i> greatest game ever released (I made this statement and forgot about <a href="http://games.activision.com/games/wolfenstein/">Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</a>) that doesn&rsquo;t cost a dime. Thanks to a US Army Marketing Strategy this game has always been free and will remain free in the future. The training is very realistic in terms of what soldiers actually go through and it looks great. My only complaint about this game is the Multi-Player mode can be somewhat limited. I wish they&rsquo;d bring back the &ldquo;Tours&rdquo; that was located in earlier versions.</p>

<p>Needless to say while I&rsquo;m happy to be having the problem corrected I&rsquo;m not

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>My relationship with <a href="http://www.anarchyonline.com/">Anarchy Online</a> has truly been a love/hate relationship.</p>

<p>I beta-tested the primary release and played at least 3-4 hours a day for the first year. After that first year Funcom still had major issues with the game and as most of my friends that had played AO were leaving I hung up my spurs so to speak.</p>

<p>After they released the first expansion pack <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/notumwars/">The Notum Wars</a> I tried to play again but just couldn&rsquo;t generate any real interest to continue playing. So once more I hung up the proverbial spurs.</p>

<p>Recently Funcom released the second expansion pack for AO called <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/shadowlands/">Shadowlands</a>. With this expansion pack Funcom has generated enough interest (with the new playfields, professions and perks system) for me to play for another couple of months.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve rolled up a Keeper (Idotychides) whose already Level 35 and plan on rolling up a Shade (name undetermined as of yet) as soon as the Keeper hits Level 50. I also need to get my Level 76 Fixer (Rimshot) up to 100.</p>

<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s enough rambling for now about AO.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>After years of having to hand edit the html/php that powered my personal website I&rsquo;ve decided to give Movable Type a try.</p>

<p>Installation was fairly straightforward on a Redhat 9 server. The biggest pain in the butt so far has been with editing the styles sheet to get something I somewhat liked. I finally wrangled it into something I can live with for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So about a month ago I bought a new Road Bike in an effort to get back in somewhat decent shape and to drop 25 pounds or so. I bought a KHS Flite 500.</p>

<p>Here are the specs:</p>

<p>Frame: Reynolds Double Butted, Full Chromoly
Fork: Full Carbon Fiber
Rims: Neuvation Radials
Hubs (F/R): Neuvation Radials
Tires: Vittoria Zaffiro, 700x23c
Spokes: Neuvation Radials 14G Stainless, Black
Deraileur, Front: Shimano Sora
Deraileur, Rear: Shimano Tiagra
Shifters: Shimano Tiagra STI
Saddle: Selle Italia XO-SUDO
Handlebar: TTT
Stem: TTT
Brake Levers: Shimano Tiagra
Frame Size: 60cm
Weight: 22.3 lbs</p>

<p>It looks like <a href="/images/khs-bike.jpg">this</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So I&rsquo;ve been having framerate issues with Star Wars Galaxies. It&rsquo;s a beautiful game and constantly getting 3-9 fps has really sucked ass. I spent some time doing some searching and found a fix. While not ideal it does allow me to get 20-30 fps.</p>

<p>The trick is to turn of AntiAliasing and Anisotropic Filtering in your video card settings. Also turn off vertex and pixel shaders in the SWG client.</p>
