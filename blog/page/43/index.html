  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>My relationship with <a href="http://www.anarchyonline.com/">Anarchy Online</a> has truly been a love/hate relationship.</p>

<p>I beta-tested the primary release and played at least 3-4 hours a day for the first year. After that first year Funcom still had major issues with the game and as most of my friends that had played AO were leaving I hung up my spurs so to speak.</p>

<p>After they released the first expansion pack <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/notumwars/">The Notum Wars</a> I tried to play again but just couldn&rsquo;t generate any real interest to continue playing. So once more I hung up the proverbial spurs.</p>

<p>Recently Funcom released the second expansion pack for AO called <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/shadowlands/">Shadowlands</a>. With this expansion pack Funcom has generated enough interest (with the new playfields, professions and perks system) for me to play for another couple of months.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve rolled up a Keeper (Idotychides) whose already Level 35 and plan on rolling up a Shade (name undetermined as of yet) as soon as the Keeper hits Level 50. I also need to get my Level 76 Fixer (Rimshot) up to 100.</p>

<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s enough rambling for now about AO.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>After years of having to hand edit the html/php that powered my personal website I&rsquo;ve decided to give Movable Type a try.</p>

<p>Installation was fairly straightforward on a Redhat 9 server. The biggest pain in the butt so far has been with editing the styles sheet to get something I somewhat liked. I finally wrangled it into something I can live with for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So about a month ago I bought a new Road Bike in an effort to get back in somewhat decent shape and to drop 25 pounds or so. I bought a KHS Flite 500.</p>

<p>Here are the specs:</p>

<p>Frame: Reynolds Double Butted, Full Chromoly
Fork: Full Carbon Fiber
Rims: Neuvation Radials
Hubs (F/R): Neuvation Radials
Tires: Vittoria Zaffiro, 700x23c
Spokes: Neuvation Radials 14G Stainless, Black
Deraileur, Front: Shimano Sora
Deraileur, Rear: Shimano Tiagra
Shifters: Shimano Tiagra STI
Saddle: Selle Italia XO-SUDO
Handlebar: TTT
Stem: TTT
Brake Levers: Shimano Tiagra
Frame Size: 60cm
Weight: 22.3 lbs</p>

<p>It looks like <a href="/images/khs-bike.jpg">this</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So I&rsquo;ve been having framerate issues with Star Wars Galaxies. It&rsquo;s a beautiful game and constantly getting 3-9 fps has really sucked ass. I spent some time doing some searching and found a fix. While not ideal it does allow me to get 20-30 fps.</p>

<p>The trick is to turn of AntiAliasing and Anisotropic Filtering in your video card settings. Also turn off vertex and pixel shaders in the SWG client.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So we&rsquo;ve announced our Board of Advisors for Damage Studios. Here&rsquo;s a copy of the press release.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Damage Studios Incorporated Forms Board of Advisors with Three Key Appointments</strong></p>

<p>Advisory Team to Bolster Damage&rsquo;s Capabilities with Expertise in Content, Corporate Strategy, Financial Management and Venture Capital</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So I spent about 3 &frac12; hours at the <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/">California Academy of Sciences</a> today. I spent most of my time in the Natural History Museum and the Steinhart Aquarium. Saw several very cool exhibits.</p>

<p>The Department of Ichthyology had an exhibit where they had x-rayed several types and species of fish. It was way cool and wasn`t expected.</p>

<p>The Steinhart Aquarium also had several cool things. One of which was the display of Burmese Vine Snakes. The aquarium was the first in the world to display these snakes. These snakes are rear fanged and venomous although their venom isn`t that dangerous to humans. They are also unique in the fact that while they are Vine/Tree Dwelling snakes they primarily eat fish and hunt from low hanging vines and limbs. It was interesting watching them hunt.</p>

<p>The Aquarium had several other snakes that were interesting to view. They had 2 Gaboon Vipers from Africa on display. It was the first time I had seen the Gaboon up close and they are very beautiful snakes.</p>

<p>Gaboons can reach a length of 4 feet on average, but lengths of 7 feet and more have been recorded. These animals will weigh about 8 to 10 kg and have a head-size of approximately 5 inches and matching fangs of 2 inches. Gaboons are the largest of the Vipers and is one of three members of the African Giant Vipers Group.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great day. I can<code>t believe that I</code>ve lived here in the Bay Area for 6 years now and just got around to visiting the Academy. If you visit San Francisco or live in the area and are interested in Reptiles I highly recommend visiting the Academy.</p>
