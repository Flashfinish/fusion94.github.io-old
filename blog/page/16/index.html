  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>The Ranger Creed was written by Command Sergeant Major Gentry in 1974. Today it is recited by Rangers during change of command ceremonies,regimental and battalion level physical training,upon graduation from Ranger school,and daily by young Rangers in the regiment.</p>

<p><font size="6">R</font>ecognizing that I volunteered as a Ranger,   fully knowing the hazards of my chosen profession.  I will always endeavor to uphold the prestige, honor and high &ldquo;esprit de corps&rdquo; of my Ranger Regiment.</p>

<p><font size="6">A</font>cknowledging the fact that a Ranger is a more elite soldier who arrives at the cutting edge of battle by land, sea, or air.  I accept the fact that as a Ranger my country expects me to move further, faster and fight harder than any other soldier.</p>

<p><font size="6">N</font>ever shall I fail my comrades.  I will always keep myself mentally alert, physically strong and morally straight and I will shoulder more than my share of the task whatever it may be.  One hundred percent and then some</p>

<p><font size="6">G</font>allantly will I show the world that I am a specially selected and well trained soldier. My courtesy to superior officers, neatness of dress and care of   equipment shall set the example for others to follow.</p>

<p><font size="6">E</font>nergetically will I meet the enemies of my country.  I shall defeat them on the field of battle for I am better trained and will fight with all my might.  Surrender is not a Ranger word.  I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy and under no circumstances will I ever embarrass my country.</p>

<p><font size="6">R</font>eadily will I display the intestinal fortitude required to fight on to the Ranger objective and complete the mission, though I be the lone survivor.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of those Rangers who have made the ultimate sacrifice while conducting operations during the GWOT.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I also went back to watched the videos a second time. In part 2 (it&rsquo;s a 3 part video) Jesse states &ldquo;If i ever have to fight again man it&rsquo;ll be to take that asshole out of office.&rdquo; This was in the context of our President. Now the law is clear here:</p>

<blockquote>THREATS AGAINST PRESIDENT - 18 USC 871, makes it a Federal crime or offense for anyone to willfully make a true threat to injure or kill the President of the United States.

 A person can be found guilty of that offense only if all of the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt:

First: That the person uttered words alleged to be the threat against the President;

Second: That the person understood and meant the words he used as a true threat; and

Third: That the person uttered the words knowingly and willfully.

A &#8220;threat&#8221; is a statement expressing an intention to kill or injure the President; and a &#8220;true threat&#8221; means a serious threat as distinguished from words used as mere political argument, idle or careless talk, or something said in a joking manner.

The essence of the offense is the knowing and willful making of a true threat. So, if it is proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the person knowingly made a true threat against the President, willfully intending that it be understood by others as a serious threat, then the offense is complete; it is not necessary to prove that the person actually intended to carry out the threat.</blockquote>


<p>I wonder if Jesse is about to get visited by the Secret Service.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I&rsquo;m not here to go into great detail as to whether or not I support the current situation in Iraq. I&rsquo;ve got friends in-country now that are on their second tours of duty there as well as some friends that have done tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless of my views I will support my friends there.</p>

<p>Anyways, the Antiwar movement, more specifically the &ldquo;Iraq Veterans Against The War&rdquo; has just suffered a &ldquo;self-inflicted&rdquo; gunshot wound to the head.</p>

<p>They shot a video of one &ldquo;Jesse Macbeth&rdquo; speaking out against the war in Iraq. Now I&rsquo;m sure that this is in fact Jesse&rsquo;s opinion about the current situation over there. And he&rsquo;s entitled to that. The issue at stake here is his credibility. Especially since he&rsquo;s making allegations of war crimes and atrocities that he witnessed.</p>

<p>Having watched the video myself I believe that Jesse Macbeth is a liar and a farce whose only purpose is to discredit our government and those men/women currently serving in our Armed Forces.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s first start out with his uniform discrepencies.</p>

<p>1) His BDU (Battle Dress Uniform) sleeves are rolled up incorrectly. I&rsquo;m referring to the &ldquo;hero photograph&rdquo; at the start of the video. Now this may seem like a minor thing but any US Army Service member learns to wear his BDU&rsquo;s properly the first few days at basic training and never forgets it. He/She would also never allow themselves to have a photograph of themself taken like that.</p>

<p>2) He&rsquo;s wearing a Ranger beret and there&rsquo;s no Ranger beret flash or Ranger unit crest present.</p>

<p>3) No Airborne Wings. You cannot be Ranger qualified or in Ranger Battalion without having first graduated Airborne school.</p>

<p>4) He&rsquo;s wearing a Special Forces Combat Patch. No one from the 3rd Ranger Battalion would be wearing the SF Patch as their combat patch. They&rsquo;d be wearing their Ranger Scroll.</p>

<p>Now lets move on to what he&rsquo;s claimed on MIlitary.com and other sites.</p>

<p>5) He claims to have three combat parachute jumps (denoted by &ldquo;mustard stains&rdquo; on his airborne wings) unfortunately for Jesse no one in 3rd Ranger Battalion made three combat jumps in 2001-05.</p>

<p>6) He claims to be Special Forces qualified. But, if he was SF and Ranger qualified, he would not be an E-4, as he would have had to have been an E-4 promotable to go to the SF Qualification course and should he have graduated the Q Course as he claims he would have then been promoted to E-5. Period.</p>

<p>7) He claims to have two Combat Infantryman&rsquo;s Badge. He would not have been awarded two CIBs for service between 2001 and 2005.</p>

<p>8) He claims to have been with the Rangers in Fallaujah. To my knowledge, 3rd Ranger Battalion was not in Fallaujah.</p>

<p>9) He claims to have been shot, wounded with shrapnel and stabbed (multiple times), but only claims one Purple Heart.</p>

<p>Army spokesman John Boyce states:</p>

<blockquote>
“Initial research by the U.S. Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg shows no Soldier with the name of Jesse Macbeth having ever been assigned to the Special Forces or the Army Rangers &#8211; which are, in fact, two separate disciplines. This appears to be some sort of hoax. No Soldier by that name at Fort Lewis to our knowledge, in the past, either. Of course, the line about &#8220;go into the Army or go to jail&#8221; is vintage TV script not heard since the 1960s. There are also numerous wear and appearance issues with the Soldier&#8217;s uniform &#8211; a mix of foreign uniforms with the sleeves rolled up like a Marine and a badly floppy tan beret worn like a pastry chef. Of course, the allegations of war crimes are vague, as are the awards the Soldier allegedly received.”</blockquote>


<p>Here are links to his interview and the videos on Youtube.
<a href="http://www.socialistalternative.org/news/article13.php?id=261">Socialist Alternative Inteview</a>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search=jessie+macbeth&search_type=search_videos&search=Search">Peace Films Interview</a></p>

<p>This is a perfect example of the Antiwar Movement to try and push their agenda upon you. And here&rsquo;s how.</p>

<p>1) Putting these interviews out knowing full well that Jesse Macbeth is lying, thereby purposefully spreading false and malicious lies about the great men who are serving their country as Rangers.
2) Putting these interviews out without doing even the most basic research to determine whether or not Jessie Macbeth was telling the truth.</p>

<p>All of these discrepencies in his statements have to give you pause as to the credibility of his other statements. If they do not then you are a bigger fool than the people that have interviewed Jesse.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Grabbed this little tip from the web. If you&rsquo;ve ever had to add multiple files to a subversion repository from the command line then you understand the pain involved. This pain can be reduced by running:
<em>
svn status | grep \? | cut -f7 -d&#8217; &lsquo; | xargs svn add</em></p>

<p>This series of commands will run run <em>svn stat</em>us, the output from that is then run through <em>grep \?</em> which finds all lines containing a question mark. The output from grep is passed to <em>cut -f7 -d&#8217; &lsquo;</em> which selects the path name, and these multiple lines are then passed on to <em>xargs svn add</em> which combines all of the unknown paths into a single call to svn add.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>According to <a href="http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-scifi-galacticaprequel,0,6083698.story?coll=zap-news-headlines">Zap2It</a> there&rsquo;s a Battlestar Galactica Prequel called <em>Caprica</em> in the works.</p>

<p><em>Caprica</em> takes place approximately 50 years before BSG does and focuses on 2 families. The Adamas and the Graystones. The 12 colonies are at peace and a technological revolution is about to occur with the creation of the first cylon.</p>

<p>No word yet as to when this will be released and my buddy that works on <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">BSG</a> hasn&rsquo;t gotten back to me.</p>

<p>SciFI now has some <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id=35773">news</a> regarding this.</p>
