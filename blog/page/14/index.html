  <p>The 39-year-old Jordanian-born terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi dubbed &ldquo;The Prince of al Qaeda in Iraq&rdquo; by Osama bin Laden had eluded U.S. and Iraqi authorities for years, often mocking them with recorded messages and videotapes.</p>

<p>His luck ran out on Wednesday, when he was killed by a coalition airstrike on what was supposed to be a &ldquo;safe house&rdquo; in Baquba.</p>

<p>Pentagon sources stated that U.S. Special Forces had tracked al-Zarqawi by following one of his key lieutenants and spiritual adviser, Sheik Abd-al-Rahman.</p>

<blockquote>
&#8220;Good morning.  Last night in Iraq, United States military forces killed the terrorist al Zarqawi.  At 6:15 p.m. Baghdad time, special operation forces, acting on tips and intelligence from Iraqis, confirmed Zarqawi&#8217;s location, and delivered justice to the most wanted terrorist in Iraq.&#8221; - President George Bush</blockquote>

  <p>NBA FINALS</p>

<p>Best-of-seven series (all games on ABC and ABCHD and all times are EST)</p>

<p><img src="http://fusion94.org/images/abchd_logo.jpg" alt="ABC HD" /></p>

<p>Thursday, June 8: Miami at Dallas, 8 p.m.
Sunday, June 11: Miami at Dallas, 8 p.m.
Tuesday, June 13: Dallas at Miami, 8 p.m.
Thursday, June 15: Dallas at Miami, 8 p.m.
Sunday, June 18: Dallas at Miami, if necessary, 8 p.m.
Tuesday, June 20: Miami at Dallas, if necessary, 8 p.m.
Thursday, June 22: Miami at Dallas, if necessary, 8 p.m.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for this series if nothing more than getting to watch all the games in HD. Comcast in it&rsquo;s infinite wisdom doesn&rsquo;t provide TNT HD for Bay Area subscribers so the Dal-Pho series looked like crap compared to the Mia-Det series (which was shown on ESPN HD). Comcast instead provides Bay Area subscribers with 2 preview HD channels. Morons.</p>

  <p>In stark contrast to the Jesse Macbeth debacle I present you Army Maj. Chase A. Freeman, of Ponca City, Nebraska, who was awarded a Bronze Star medal of valor for his role in a firefight in Afghanistan on Oct. 10, 2005.</p>

<blockquote>
Major Chase A. Freeman, United States Army, distinguished himself by exceptional valor under fire during combat operations from 10 to 11 October 2005 in vicinity of Bagh-Khosak Village, Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan.

While on patrol Maj. Freeman and his team were attacked by approximately 150 enemy soldiers from 3 separate ambush positions.

Maj. Freeman assessed the situation and realized that because of all the heavy fighting, his ANA soldiers were going to need a re-supply of ammunition. He knew that the only re-supply of ammunition was located in an abandoned truck left at the initial attack position.

There is little doubt that Major Freeman’s leadership and personal courage allowed his unit to maneuver on and destroy over 45 enemy personnel during a 13-hour period.</blockquote>


<p>You can read more about Major Freeman <a href="http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2006/05/21/top_story/doc446fbb6726846773205062.txt">here</a>.</p>
