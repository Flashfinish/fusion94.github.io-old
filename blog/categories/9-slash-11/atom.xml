    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was up all night playing Anarchy Online last night and was still playing this morning at 7:00am PST when the canadian called me on my cell. At first I was like wtf is he doing calling me at this time of the morning? When I answered the phone the first thing out of his mouth was &ldquo;turn on CNN&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So I did. And was amazed/shocked by what I was seeing. It was unbelievable. After a few minutes I was called him back to find out what was going on down south and he mentioned that him and mej were glued to the TV. I jumped on the bike  and hit 101 at about 120mph. I do believe that that&rsquo;s the fastest I&rsquo;ve ever made it from SF to San Jose.</p>

<p>I stayed down there all day watching CNN and a few other people came by throughout the day. All I can say is that I&rsquo;m saddened and shocked by the events that transpired today. I wonder how this is going to play out as someone&rsquo;s going to pay for this.</p>
