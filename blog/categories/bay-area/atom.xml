    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So the news is out&hellip;.Barry Bonds has been indicted for perjury. And it appears that some of the liberals in the Bay Area are now clamoring for his head. Here are a few quotes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;im a born sf chick, a lifelong giants fan&hellip;&hellip;and i hope barry finally gets what he deserves! the arrogant person that he is. i can&rsquo;t stand the guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder how he&rsquo;ll look in a bright orange jumpsuit? Maybe he can share a cell with Greg Anderson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;he cheats &mdash; while breaking the most important record in sports. he lies &mdash; to a grand jury. good riddance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fantastic! I hope ASSterisk and his big head spends some time behind bars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friggin Finally. Send him to jail and lets never mention his name again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whats amazing about this is that these are quotes from Bay Area people who are known for being fairly liberal. I wonder if you were the same people that defended Bill Clinton for committing perjury because it was just a lie about sex to congress.</p>

<p>Hypocrites&hellip;.</p>
