    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>UAV&rsquo;s or unmanned aerial vehicle, sometimes called an unmanned air-reconnaissance vehicle, is an unpiloted aircraft. UAVs can be remote controlled or fly autonomously based on pre-programmed flight plans or more complex dynamic automation systems.</p>

<p>Wired Science has a video about them which I&rsquo;ve embedded below. About &frac12; through the video Wired talks to Adam Williams about his helicopoter UAV. It was surprise to see it as Adam worked at VA Software back in the day doing linear video editing software.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of yesterday all of Yahoo&rsquo;s esitmated 248 million users worldwide now have the means to login to any site that supports OpenID. Currently they are only an OpenID provider and not a consumer which means that you cannot login to Yahoo services using your OpenID but I&rsquo;d imagine that will change sometime in the near future.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t enabled your Yahoo account for OpenID access then head over to <a href="http://openid.yahoo.com"><a href="http://openid.yahoo.com">http://openid.yahoo.com</a></a> and do so.</p>

    <link href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2008/01/29/drupal-themes-mission-statement/"/>
    <updated>2008-01-29T09:33:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2008/01/29/drupal-themes-mission-statement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In some <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes">Drupal Themes</a> there is support for displaying the &ldquo;Mission Statement&rdquo; across all pages and in others this support is limited to the &ldquo;Front Page&rdquo; or &ldquo;Main Page&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you are ever using one of the themes with limited mission statement support and want to display the mission statement across all pages you can use this to do so.</p>

<p>In template.php add the following to the bottom of the file:</p>

<p><code>function _phptemplate_variables($hook, $vars = array()) {
  // Make custom variables available to theme templates
  switch ($hook) {</p>

<pre><code>// Send new variable $custom_mission to page.tpl.php
case 'page':
  $vars['custom_mission'] = variable_get('site_mission', '');
  break;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  return $vars;
}
</code></p>

<p>Then in page.tpl.php change:</p>

<p><code>&lt;?php if ($mission) { ?><h3 id="mission">&lt;?php print $mission ?></h3>&lt;?php } ?></code>
to be</p>

<p><code>&lt;?php if ($custom_mission) { ?><h3 id="mission">&lt;?php print $custom_mission ?></h3>&lt;?php } ?></code></p>

<p>These 2 changes should allow the &ldquo;Mission Statement&rdquo; to be displayed across all pages.</p>

    <link href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2007/05/08/silverlight-vs-flash/"/>
    <updated>2007-05-08T09:46:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://fusion94.org/blog/2007/05/08/silverlight-vs-flash</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been quite a bit of discussion in regards to whether or not Silverlight is a Flash killer etc.</p>

<p>I believe PiperJaffray Analysts said it best with this:</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft&rsquo;s Silverlight: Loud Bark, Soft Bite?</strong>
<strong>KEY POINTS:</strong>
• Microsoft recently unveiled Silverlight, a supposed Flash rival.
• We expect Silverlight&rsquo;s impact on Adobe&rsquo;s business to be immaterial.
• Flash is the web&rsquo;s fastest growing video distribution platform on the web,
and the developer community is committed to Flash as a standard for RIAs.
• Adobe is pushing ahead in online video with Apollo and Adobe Media Player.</p>

<p><strong>What Is Silverlight? </strong>Microsoft recently demonstrated its new Silverlight
technology, a web development tool for rich Internet applications (RIAs) and a
supposed rival to Adobe&rsquo;s Flash and Flex. The Silverlight runtime is available as a
cross-platform beta plug-in available for web browsers including Internet Explorer,
Firefox, and Safari; Microsoft expects to have a final release by mid-2007.</p>

<p><strong>Silverlight&rsquo;s Impact Will Be Immaterial.</strong> We believe Silverlight&rsquo;s impact on Flash
and Flex will be minimal for three reasons: 1) Flash video technology is the fastest
growing video distribution platform on the Internet; Adobe has a growing lead in
the RIA space. YouTube, for example, which uses Flash technology, garnered an
audience of ~45m unique users in March (up from ~13m a year ago); 2) Microsoft
plays catch-up with Adobe, Adobe continues to innovate. On 4/15 we attended the
NAB tradeshow where Adobe focused on its plans for online Video. Specifically,
the company introduced Adobe Media Player, the next leg in Adobe&rsquo;s video
strategy, which builds on the success of Flash and implements the new Apollo
technology; and 3) Web developers are loyal to Adobe (and ex-Macromedia)
products, and now that CS3 integrates Adobe&rsquo;s design products with the
Macromedia tools, we expect the Flash developer base will become even more
deeply entrenched in Flash and Flex as standards for RIAs. In early 2006, Adobe
had announced that there were more than 2 million Flash developers.</p>
