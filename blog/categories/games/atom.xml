    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I finally got around to releasing a package of the Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Dedicated Servers.</p>

<p>They can be downloaded <a href="http://fusion94.org//files/MoHAA_Dedicated_Servers_1.2.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>I plan on releasing new versions of the Game Server Configurator: MoHAA in the next few weeks and you will need these to use that tool.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b>
These are command line server binaries that allow you to host a MoHAA server without running the MoHAA client.</p>

<p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b>
These binaries are released as a non-supported product. That means that neither Aspyr Media, Inc. nor Damage Studios technical support center can answer or help with any issues you may encounter with this release.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My fantasy football season ended last night.</p>

<p>In the Skyfire League I ended up with the best overall record of 11-3 with 1,486 points scored and went into the playoffs as the #1 seed. I ended up losing my first playoff game but was able to rally and capture the third place trophy.</p>

<p>In the Public League I ended up with a record of 7-6-1 with 1,293 points scored and went into the playoffs as the #4 seed. Due to quite a bit of luck I won out all my playoff games and captured the first place trophy.</p>
